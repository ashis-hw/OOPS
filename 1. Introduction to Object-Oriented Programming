ðŸ‘‰  Object oriented programming is a way to write our code. 

ðŸ‘‰  It's simplest way to write one function do everything inside this function what ever task your software 
     supposed to do like taking input,doing some computation and giving some results you write everything in this one function, 

ðŸ‘‰  What is the problem with this approach?
    see this approach is fine when we are writing a small piece of code,like a code, which is finding average of some numbers or doing some simple
    mathematical computation But if our code evolvs we sould have many tasks which are repeated again and again,like finding maximum in an  array 
    printing date,and many other things, sorting an array for that what we do is we make functions So, that if something is repeated again and again,
    we write a function for this, and we call this function,whenever we need this functionality,this way of programming is called procedural programming.

ðŸ‘‰  What happens in procedural programming?
    We have multiple functions call each other and our main function is typically a driver function This calls other functions and then these functions
    might calls other functions,and this is how our procedural programming happens.

ðŸ‘‰  We can do procedural programming in java just i making one class writing one function main inside it and more function which main is supposed to call. 
    But java ancourage is object oriented ptogramming in java its mandatory to write everything in the ckass that means the idea of object oriented programming
    is recommended to have classes and write everything inside the class.

ðŸ‘‰  What are the problem with procedural programming?
    If our software goes relatively bigger and it has multiple entities, which are talking to each other the functional programming may not be a good idea to do it.
    Consider a situation where we are making a software for a college there are entities like student, courses, teachers. We read all the data from a file, or
    a database. And how do we store it in memory? we will probably make an array of student data, make an array of teacher data, make an array of courses and
    then whatever we want to do on this data,we will have to pass these areas averywhere which makes a code really,really complex.

ðŸ‘‰  Object oriented programming is a way to divide our requirements into multiple entities like we are talk about college software, we have a student entity,
     we have a course entity,we have a faculty entity, we make classes of these entities, then we make object of these entities. So class is kind of datatype. 
     A student is a class,for example. And if there is a student whose name is Ashis, Ashis is object of that class another student Ankan is an object of this class.

ðŸ‘‰  How class datatype is different from basic datatype


ðŸ‘Œ  EXAMPLE:

    We have complex is an class and c1 is object of complex class


    import java.math.*;
    import java.io.*;
    import java.util.*;

    class Complex
    {
       int real, imag;

       void print()
       {
           System.out.println(real + " +i"+ imag);
       }

       Complex(int r, int i)
       {
           real = r;
        imag = i;
       }

       void add(Complex C)
       {
           real += C.real;
           imag += C.imag; 
       }
    }
    public class example1
    { 
       public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException 
       { 
      
           Complex c1 = new Complex(10, 20);

           c1.print();

           Complex c2 = new Complex(20, 30);

           c1.add(c2);

           c1.print();   

       } 
     } 



   Output:
   10 +i20
   30 +i50
